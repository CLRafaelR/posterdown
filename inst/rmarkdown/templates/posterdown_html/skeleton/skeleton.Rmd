Bellow you will find typical RMarkdown syntax which should fill in the columns for the poster from top to bottom left to right. The more information you have the more will be filled. Please let me know if you have feedback at brentthorne18@gmail.com or at github.com/brentthorne/posterdown.

# Introduction

Welcome to `posterdown` ! This is my attempt to provide a semi-smooth workflow for those who wish to take their `RMarkdown` skills to the conference world. Many creature comforts from `RMarkdown` are available in this package such as `Markdown` section notation, figure captioning, and even citations like this one. The rest of this example poster will show how you can insert typical conference poster features into your own document. 

## Study Site

Here is a map made to show the study site using `ggplot2`, `ggspatial`, and `sf` and you can even reference this with a hyperlink, this will take you to **Figure \@ref(fig:mymapfig)**.


```{r, mymapfig, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE, fig.cap='Map of Long Lake eample from the [ggspatial](github.com/paleolimbot/ggspatial) package.'}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggspatial)

load_longlake_data()

ggplot() +  
  annotation_map_tile() +
  layer_spatial(longlake_depthdf, aes(colour = DEPTH)) +
  annotation_scale(location = "tl") +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "br") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

# Objectives

1. Easy to use reproducible poster design. 
2. Integration with `RMarkdown`.
3. Easy transition from `posterdown` to `thesisdown` or `rticles`

# Methods

This package uses the same workflow approach as the `RMarkdown` you know and love. Basically it goes from RMarkdown > Knitr > Markdown > Pandoc > HTML/CSS > PDF. You can even use the bibliography the same way [@turnerControlsWaterBalance2014].

# Results

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calcualated. In posterdown this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical `RMarkdown` formatting. I suggesting checking out the `kableExtra` package and its in depth documentation on customizing these tables found [here](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf). Hopfully I can make this with an inline refernce like, Table \@ref(tab:mytable).


```{r, mytable, out.width='80%'}
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(iris[1:5, 1:4], caption = 'Table caption.',align = 'c',"html") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE)
```


```{r, out.width='100%', fig.height=10, fig.cap='Using ggplot and patchwork to generate a layout of multiple plots in one figure. The iris dataset was used to generate (a) a line graph, (b) a scatterplot, and (c) a boxplot all together!'}

library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(ggthemes)

theme_set(theme_gray() + theme_tufte() + theme(legend.position = "none"))

base <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species))
  
p_point <- base + geom_point()
p_line  <- base + geom_line() 
p_area  <- base + geom_area()
p_box1  <- ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species))
p_box2  <- ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, fill = Species))

p_line + 
  {p_point + p_box1} +
  plot_layout(ncol = 1) + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "a", tag_prefix = "(",tag_suffix = ")")

```


```{r, out.width='85%', fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4, fig.cap='Another typical plot using ggplot, this time with a different theme and r code chunk options for fig.width and fig.height.'}

library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(x = "Sepal Length", y = "Sepeal Width") +
  NULL

```


```{r, out.width='80%', fig.width=4.5, fig.align='center', echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.cap='Another figure showing how base R plots might look on this poster!'}

# Here is some code for people
# to look at and be in awe of!!
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(data=iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width,
                      y = Sepal.Length,
                      colour = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_tufte() +
  NULL

```

# Next Steps

There is still **A LOT** of work to do on this package which include (but are note limited to): 

- Better softcoding for front end user options in YAML
- Images in the title section for logo placement which is a common attribut to posters as far as I have come to know.
- Figure out compatiability with `natbib` which wasn't working during the initial set up.
- MUCH BETTER PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION. For example, there is nothing in the README...
- Include References section only if initiated by the user like in RMarkdown.
