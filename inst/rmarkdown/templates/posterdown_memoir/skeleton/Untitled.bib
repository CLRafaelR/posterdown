  abstract = {Aeromagnetic data is important for the exploration of gold and other hydrothermal deposits because geologically favourable environments are associated with changes in rock magnetism. For example, Archean orogenic gold mineralisation is known to be present in areas of structural complexity near major shear-zones that form conduits for mineralising ﬂuids. Potential ﬂuid pathways such as shear zones and faults are often associated with magnetite destructive alteration resulting in linear negative anomalies in magnetic data. Here, we present a new image analysis method that identiﬁes geological structural complexity using lineaments automatically mapped within magnetic data. This quantitative analysis is efﬁcient and self consistent in dealing with large volumes of data, and is suitable as a ﬁrst-pass ground selection tool for orogenic gold exploration in greenﬁeld terrains.},
